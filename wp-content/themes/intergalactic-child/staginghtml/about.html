          <p>
          Circa 2008-09. One apartment, 5 people, strong belief, clear idea – it’s the beginning where friends and family pitch in with money, support, cheerleading and of course endless cups of coffee.

          <p>
          During the course of their idle doodles and quick bites and endless cups of coffee, the 3 founders, Chetan, Gourav and Vikram have an epiphany. They realize 3 things:
		  <br/> * Marketers have data<br/>
		   * Data isn’t helping them secure more customers<br/>
		  * Technology can help bridge that gap
		  <br/>The trio wanted to not only help marketers “show them the money”, but secure customers for life.

          3 friends. Working at the same company, Trilogy (the number 3 may have a lead role to play in this story, Trilogy for starters), have lunch, discuss state of affairs. Their discussions lead to a simple question: why aren’t most marketers able to capitalize on 98% of the customers?
