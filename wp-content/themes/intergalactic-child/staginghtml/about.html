          During the course of their idle doodles and quick bites and endless cups of coffee, the 3 founders, Chetan, Gourav and Vikram have an epiphany. They realize 3 things:
		  <br/><br/> * Marketers have data
		  <br/> * Data isn’t helping them secure more customers
		  <br/> * Technology can help bridge that gap
		  <br/><br/>The trio wanted to not only help marketers “show them the money”, but secure customers for life.
